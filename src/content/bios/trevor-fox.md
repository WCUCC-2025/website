I am Trevor, a biochemistry major in his fourth year at UBCO. This year, I serve
dutifully as one of the architects for this website! I also conduct research
focused on the field of metabolomics. I just finished developing and validating
a method to predict the species of origin of frankincense based on 60 and 400
MHz NMR spectra. In the past, I have also led the wet lab of UBCO’s
International Genetically Engineered Machine competition team, where we
endeavoured to produce bioluminescent cyanobacteria. I love exploring new
avenues to accomplish things, as evident in my line of research. My hobbies
include playing piano, programming, ice skating/skiing, and cooking. One might
say I am “multivalent!” 

**Fun Fact:** Bismuth is my favourite element, not only
because it’s pretty, but also because its half-life is longer than the
universe's age.
